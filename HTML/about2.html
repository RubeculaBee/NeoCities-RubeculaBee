                Hello! I'm a nerdy girl with nerdy hobbies. Young but old enough to take care of myself.
                Gamer, but usually of the indie variety. Sorry I didn't play any of the games that were in the game awards...
                Recoving gacha addict (failing). Hobby Game and Web dev.
                Friendly, the least judgemental person you'll probably meet.
                I have no enemies (even if my friends think I should).
                I say I have no trauma, but no one seems to agree with me!
                Unapologtic perv, sometimes in ways people don't like.
                Sometimes people find Rubecula hard to pronounce, so you can call Bee, or R,
                or whatever you want really as long as I can understand that you're talking about me!
                <br><br>
                I've created this space because I long to be able to express myself. Also I'm bored. I've been practicing coding for most of
                my life, so why not put it together for an art project, yeah? I'll mostly be active here updating my blog, but if I make
                art or some other project, I'll put it up here too. This website is kind of an experiment in figuring out who I am really.
                I always had trouble defining myself, and I've also never really had a presence online. I'm lurker, through and true.
                Maybe by turning myself into art I can figure out who I am.
                <br><br>
                Have fun!
