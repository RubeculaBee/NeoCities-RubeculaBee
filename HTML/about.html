                This is my home. A place to be truly free.
                This is freedom. A place I can call Home.
                Have you ever wanted to be yourself? Fully?
                This is a place of no fear.
                What you are looking at is my soul, nothing less.
                This is the barest part of me, my Mind, reflected.
                An archive of my own.
                I just want to be safe.
                I just want to be me.
                Please don't twist the knife.
            </p>

                I am girl that would like to live more than survive.
                I am no one who I want to be.
                I am happy when I am not.
                Some would call me smart, some would call me arrogant,
                some would call me cute, some would call me stubborn,
                some would call me kind, some would call me selfish.
                I am a sad, weird girl, with a fascination with the strange,
                with the tools to show my soul, and with the interests to fill my heart.
                My name is RubeculaBee.
